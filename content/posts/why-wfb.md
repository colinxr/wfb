The idea of working from bed first came across my desk ten years ago in an interview with comedian John Hodgman. The writer asks Hodgman to describe his workspace, to which he replies:

> I do not stand up. I lie down. While I’ve written in bed occasionally since college, I would always feel guilty about it and try to keep to the desk. But now that I am 42 I do not care anymore what humans think, so I pulled out the sofa bed in my home office and now do everything there. It’s the most productive I’ve been in years, and it makes the nap transitions incredibly smooth.

I dismissed this outright. Working from bed I thought was indulgent and frivolous, fundamentally unserious. Hodgman, the comedian, after all, was fundamentally unserious himself. My relationship to work was grounded in a protestant ethic. Hard work was good and worthy. And as I began my career, I brought this ethic with me.

But then the pandemic happened, and slowly that relationship was forced to change. Despite the convenience of working at home, the daily routine became a slog, draining and pointless. I was burnt out.

So I don’t know when exactly I started working from bed. But it has become such a welcome adjustment, a kind of self-care. It represents a new kind of work, more inclusive and kind. It’s about showing up where you are. The pandemic ripped away the long-time aesthetics of work which was then allowed to take up a new postures.

The age-old aesthetics of work have long been uncomfortable for many. In 2021, a survey made headlines in business publications when it showed black folks working remotely feel more valued and supported than when they worked in the office.

In discussions around disabilities, Spoon Theory is a popular metaphor to describe someone’s lived day-to-day experience. A spoon represents different units of energy, and every day you get a finite number of spoons. Through the day things take up more spoons. Some days getting out of bed takes no spoons, other days it take five spoons. The numbers don’t actually matter. What’s important is we begin to treat our energy and stamina as the finite resources that they are.

Yes, WFB is an attitude and a metaphor.
