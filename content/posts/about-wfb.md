Working From Bed is a full-stack digital agency and product lab. Committed to helping new brands, entrepreneurs, artists, creatives grow their online presence. We help guide our clients through every step of the funnel. We're taking what we've learned through our own product wins and losses and using that to our clients' advantage.

Our development process is built on on modern and effective solutions, allowing for an iterative approach where curveballs are welcomed as much as expected. Our products are modular, scaleable, and performant. We're available for project work or on a consultation basis. We love helping companies and agencies update their development workflows.

### Having issues with your tech stack? Send us an email and let's see where WFB can help.

WFB specializes in person-first, data-driven digital strategy. We are fundamentally excited by people and what makes them tick. Whether its audience development or ecommece sales analysis, we've been using data to tell stories to brands for almost ten years now.

It's important to move past demographics and focus on audience's core psychology. The OCEAN model of personality is a key part of any engagement. Afterall, people will always tell you who they are, you simply have to listen.
