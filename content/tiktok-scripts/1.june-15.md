So today I walked to Silverlake to do some work at cafe there.

LA is in June Gloom right now. Something about the ocean still being cold, makes clouds which get trapped over the city by the mountains.

Here's a little WGA picket line outside this big studio in Los Feliz. I think Disney owns this one.

Today I'm waiting on feedback from a client about some designs, so I'm starting to write a little newsletter roundup for Workng From Bed, and then building a link-in-bio page for the website to promote on instagram.
