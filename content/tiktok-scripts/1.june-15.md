So today I walked to Silverlake to do some work at cafe there.

I walked through the neighbourhood past all these beautiful houses and gardens.

Here's a little WGA picket line outside this big studio in Los Feliz. I think Disney owns this one.

The cafe was nice and had good music. At one point a very sad looking Ed Helms walked in.

I'm waiting on feedback from a client about some designs, so Today I worked on newsletter rounded up for Workng From Bed, and then built a little link-in-bio page for the website so I could promote on social.

I launched the Working From Bed last week and the response has been really great so far. It's been exciting to start a company like this. You can check it out at the link in my bio. Follow for to get updates about what its like starting your own digital agency.
